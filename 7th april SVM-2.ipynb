    "Certainly! Let's address each question and then proceed with the assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q1. Relationship between Polynomial Functions and Kernel Functions:\n",
    "In machine learning, a polynomial kernel is a type of kernel function that implicitly computes the dot product in a higher-dimensional space. Polynomial functions share this concept, as they involve terms raised to different powers. The polynomial kernel function allows linear models to capture non-linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. Implementing SVM with Polynomial Kernel in Python using Scikit-learn:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn import datasets\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "from sklearn.svm import SVC\n",
    "from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the dataset (replace 'your_dataset' with the actual dataset)\n",
    "data = datasets.load_your_dataset()\n",
    "X = data.data\n",
    "y = data.target\n",
    "\n",
    "# Split the dataset into training and testing sets\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an instance of the SVC classifier with a polynomial kernel\n",
    "svm_classifier = SVC(kernel='poly', degree=3, C=1.0)  # Adjust degree and C as needed\n",
    "\n",
    "# Train the classifier on the training data\n",
    "svm_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use the trained classifier to predict labels of the testing data\n",
    "y_pred = svm_classifier.predict(X_test)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluate the performance using accuracy\n",
    "accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\n",
    "print(f\"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. Effect of Increasing Epsilon on the Number of Support Vectors in SVR:\n",
    "In Support Vector Regression (SVR), epsilon (\\(\\epsilon\\)) is a hyperparameter that determines the width of the margin. Increasing \\(\\epsilon\\) allows more data points to be within the margin, potentially increasing the number of support vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. Parameters in Support Vector Regression (SVR):\n",
    "- **Kernel Function:** Choice of the kernel function (linear, polynomial, radial basis function, etc.) determines the transformation applied to the input features.\n",
    "- **C Parameter:** Penalty parameter for the error term. A smaller C encourages a smoother decision surface, while a larger C may lead to a more complex model.\n",
    "- **Epsilon Parameter:** Width of the margin. Larger \\(\\epsilon\\) allows more data points within the margin.\n",
    "- **Gamma Parameter:** Controls the influence of a single training example. Smaller values consider a larger region for similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment:\n",
    "Here's a template for the assignment. Make sure to replace 'your_dataset' with the actual dataset and adjust hyperparameters accordingly:\n",
